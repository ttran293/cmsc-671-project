{"instruction": "Summarize the following text.", "input": "One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me. The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word. It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away. I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.", "output": "One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked.

{"instruction": "Summarize the following text.", "input": "A wonderful little production. The filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-BBC fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. The actors are extremely well chosen- Michael Sheen not only \"has got all the polari\" but he has all the voices down pat too! You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with Halliwell's murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.", "output": "A wonderful little production that uses an understated filmmaking style reminiscent of classic BBC productions, effectively creating a realistic feel through old-time techniques. The actors deliver outstanding performances, particularly Michael Sheen, who convincingly portrays Polari and various voices. The production seamlessly integrates references to Williams' diary entries, resulting in a well-written and engaging story. The attention to detail shines through in subtle elements, such as the guard's fantasy sequence that remains grounded before disappearing."}

Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat. The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter. The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.

{"instruction": "Summarize the following text.", "input": "Okay, I’m about to open up about many things I’ve done in my past that I’m not proud of. I’m not that person anymore. In these stories I was 17 and immature as fuck. I’m now 22 with a total different take on life. I became best friends with this girl in 2017. We were both 17 at the time. We did everything together. We smoked weed daily. Sleepovers. Longboard together. Did acid together. We did everything together. We would die for each other. Once we robbed our mutual friends house. We stole $200 from the girls dad. I ended up telling the girl and paid her back Bc I felt bad. Once we robbed a building and made out with $1,500 and never got caught. Once we robbed a house we thought was someone we knew who just robbed us. Turned out it was a fake address he gave us and we robbed a random house. We never got caught. Once we got arrested for robbing cars off acid while drunk. We caught some fines for that. We did a lot of sneaky bad shit together. After the last time we got caught, we stopped doing all that shit. We were doing really well. Long story short this is how our friendship ended.⬇️ I was dating a super toxic dude and she’d tell me to leave him all the time. Finally I left him. We went to a party and had a fucking blast. The next day I went home and sent her this whole long text about how her and her bf were toxic and that they should break up. She didn’t take that lightly. I don’t blame her I wasn’t nice about it and it came out of no where. We were literally fine the day before. I ended up switching schools and she started rumors that I wanted to break them up because I wanted her boyfriend and he told everyone I tried to kiss him. Not true. He didn’t like me because she spent more time with me than him and he voiced that all the time. Then I got with my current boyfriend HERE IT IS... I got my boyfriend to rob her house. I specifically said he could only take weed related things. No money and can’t steal from her mom. So he took two bongs and 8gs of weed. She assumed it was me right away Bc who else knew her window didn’t shut. I finally admitted to her like 5/6 months later during our graduation. When I told her, it looked like she wanted to kill me but she kept her cool on the outside. Let’s call my best friend that I had my bf rob - Katrina Let’s call the girl Katrina and I robbed $200 from her parents - Yazra Yazra wasn’t mad at Katrina or Me for robbing her parents. She accepted out apology. Yazra invited me and Katrina to her graduation party. We both show up and there I gave Katrina $300 to make up for what I had robbed. She didn’t seem happy. I don’t blame her. It’s been 5ish years since 2017 when we were best friends. We are friends on Facebook but we don’t talk. Last week I shared a post that says “if you were ever my closet friend at one point just know I think about you from time to time and hope you’re doing great things in life” and she heart reacted my post 4 days ago I saw her at the liquor store. She was right behind me in line. I was consumed in anxiety and couldn’t even bring myself to say hi or even look at her. When we first saw each other we both looked shook and then quickly looked/walked away. She also said nothing. I really really want to be her friend again. I cry over her all the time. I vent about her in my journals. I write letters that I think I would one day send to her but never do. Do you think she forgave me? Do you think she misses me? Do you think she could give me a chance again? Do you think she’s even capable of trusting me again? Don’t you think she could forgive me after everything we did to other people? Do you think I should try to message her? I apologized 100 times back in 2018 during graduation and at the graduation party and repaid her. What should I say if I do message her? I really don’t want to never message her and move on from her. She’s really special to me. I love her a lot. She was the best friend I ever had besides all the bad stuff we did. I know we are both grown up now and we wouldn’t do any more stupid reckless shit if we were friends again. Help.
